# ImageRecognitionApp
Built a CNN model and deployed it on flask server.

To run this app , you need a pretrained model on Cats and dogs dataset. I didn't upload it because it was of very large size.
Once you have that in .h5 format , put it in the root directory . 
If all the dependencies are installed (keras, tf ,..) , run it using python static/predict.html in terminal.
